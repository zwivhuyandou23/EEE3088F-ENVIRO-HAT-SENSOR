### ENVIRO-SENSING-HAT


## Name
ENVIRO-SENSING-HAT

## Description

The ENVIRO-SENSING-HAT is a design project that incorporates a Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) and a temperature sensor with an onboard FTDI IC chip. This HAT (Hardware Attached on Top) is designed to provide environmental sensing capabilities for various applications.

## Features

- Light Dependent Resistor (LDR) for monitoring light levels
- Temperature sensor for measuring ambient temperature
- Onboard FTDI IC chip for communication and data transfer
- Customizable and programmable for different applications

## Project Scenarios

The ENVIRO-SENSING-HAT can be used in various scenarios to monitor and analyze environmental conditions. Some of the key scenarios include:

1. **Fire Detection:** The HAT can monitor light levels and temperature. In the case of a fire, the light levels and temperature will rise to extreme levels. The HAT can be integrated into a fire detection system where it triggers an alarm if the levels exceed a certain threshold.

2. **Weather Station:** By monitoring light levels and temperature, the HAT can be used as part of a weather station for weather forecasting purposes. It can collect data over time to analyze weather patterns and provide valuable insights.

3. **Greenhouse Control System:** In a greenhouse, the HAT can be integrated into a control system to monitor environmental conditions. It can detect light levels and temperature to determine the optimal conditions for plant growth. The HAT can control fans and irrigation systems based on the detected environmental conditions.

## Installation
To access some of the contents on the repo you will need kicad to open the project PCB, Schematics designs and an IDE that supports C programming

## Usage

To use the ENVIRO-SENSING-HAT, you need to connect it to a compatible development board or microcontroller. You can refer to the documentation or specifications of your specific board to understand how to interface with the HAT. Additionally, you may need to install any required libraries or drivers for proper functionality.

Once the HAT is properly connected, you can develop software or write code to read data from the LDR and temperature sensor, and utilize the onboard FTDI IC chip for communication and data transfer.
